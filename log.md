# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started with Flutter, completed a codelab session on "Building Beautiful UIs with Flutter".

**Thoughts:** Coming from Android(Java/Kotlin) to Flutter, it will take sometime go get used to the syntax. Loving the hot reload feature though.
