# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started with Flutter, completed a codelab session on "Building Beautiful UIs with Flutter".

**Thoughts:** Coming from Android(Java/Kotlin) to Flutter, it will take sometime go get used to the syntax. Loving the hot reload feature though.

### Day 2: February 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learning from Siraj Raval's youtube channel and solved his challenge of making a gender classifier using scikit learn.

**Thoughts:** As Siraj says, "No PhD required for Data Science."
